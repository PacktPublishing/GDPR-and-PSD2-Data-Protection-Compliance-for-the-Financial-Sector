Financial gain is still one of the major motivations behind most cybercriminal activities and there is little chance of this changing in the near future. One trend that has become evident over the last year is that cybercriminals are increasingly moving beyond banking customers and are now also targeting financial institutions directly using top of the rock financial malware. So how can we protect using cloud security and why cloud security is the best approach instead of on premises tools? Once inside the financial institutionâ€™s network, the attacker can learn how to transfer money, issue fraudulent transactions, or orchestrate ATM machines to dispense cash, these being the end result of the financial malware. Boost your career by understanding the mechanisms behind financial malware and what banks are looking for in choosing their anti-malware solutions and why cloud security is the best option in this case!
